                When Joseph Smith told Grandpa [i.e., Willard Richards] to take another wife, he had no one in mind; 
                so the Prophet said, "Willard, what about some of the women you knew in England?" And immediately
                Grandfather thought of the Longstroth family and how they had taken good care of him when he was so 
                ill. The Longstroths had come to America and were living in St. Louis, and Willard went down there 
                and asked the parents for Sarah and Nanny. Sarah was sixteen, and Nanny was fourteen. The parents 
                thought Nanny was too young, so Willard said, "Let me marry her, and she can come back home and stay 
                with you and when you feel that she is ready you can send her to me." With the consent of the girls 
                this was agreed upon. A few weeks later, Grandpa Longstroth brought the girls to Nauvoo. They married 
                Dr. Willard Richards in January 1843. Joseph Smith performed the ceremony. Nanny returned to St. Louis 
                with her father, and Sarah may have stayed in Nauvoo for awhile, but later was with her family in 
                Rockport, Mo. where they were living in 1843 and early 1844. The Longstroths moved to Nauvoo in Mar 1844 
                and it is known that Sarah was living with her family when Willarƒès wife Jennetta died (July 1845). 
                Sarah and Nanny were sealed to Willard Richards in the Nauvoo Temple Jan[uary] 22 and 25, 1846 and it was 
                after this time that the marriages were consumated.\n
